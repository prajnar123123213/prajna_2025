    "- What makes our projet unique?: \n",
    "    - Our projet is different from others because of it's accessable and teaching nature. Other projects are something that you can use or admire (like the bathroon pass, for example, is very impressive and useful for many people). Our project has features that are maybe not practical, but have educational qualities. No one would want to use a Pet trainer game or something like that in general, but the attatched blogs and documentations that we included throughout the website makes our features more accessable by giving usere a hands-on tool that they can use; **making complex topics more approachable and easier to learn.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- What did I do to contribute?\n",
    "    - As the scrum master, I focused on finished my feature and blog first in order to give the rest of my teammates a sort of structure or foundation that they can build their features based on. I also helped all of them (except for Alex) debug and fix the errors that they were getting when working with the backend. As most of the group, myslef included, is new to coding, I made sure that we all helped each other and got our work done on time, even when we were struggling with learning a new coding concept. \n"

    "- These lessons cover essential principles of computer science and digital responsibility, exploring how technology affects individuals and society. \n",
    "    - The topics range from ethical concerns like digital privacy and equity to algorithmic logic such as binary search and complexity analysis.\n",
    "    - Technical aspects: Variables, Data abstractions, Mathematics, Conditionals. \n",
    "        - Most of these concepts connect back to the binary or bite system, and it's important to understand how conversion between written language and computer language occurs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Our Lesson\n",
    "\n",
    "- I taught the neutral side of beneficial and harmful effects, showing how a dilema isn't always two-sided, and problems in the computational world can often be very complex. "

    "I've grown a lot as a computer science student over this entire year, and I still remember when me and Arshia would complain and struggle over created our \"About Me\" pages. Inserting an image by using site.baseurl seemed like the hardest thing at that time, but not I feel confident in usine API endpoints and navigatig backend/frontend integration. I also am a lot better at debugging and fixing my own mistakes, as well as helped others. 2nd tri I would frequently come up with questions on this and that, never fully able to understand how to fix my own code. I think this trimester especially has helepd me understand how to use resources like peers and ChatGPT in a beneficial way for debugging. Finally, I think there is obviously still a lot of room for important in terms of things like AWS deployment. Although I deployed by myself in 2nd tri, I forgot the entire process the second I finished it, so a future goal would be for me to continue practicing and re-learning the entire process because deployment is the only way that our grouops hard work and efforts can be shared with the rest of the world.
