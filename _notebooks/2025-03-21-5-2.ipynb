    "In my own community, I've seen how online schooling back in 2020 negatively affected my family back in India. They come from a lower socio-economic class and technology isn't readily availabe for them. Being blocked and kept from going to school in-person affected the education that many of my cousins got. This was extremley different from my own online schooling experience, since I'm more privilaged in the sense that I have access to technology, which is an example of the Digital Divide. To solve this issue, I think they can do something similar to PUSD, when they lended school chrombeooks to all students, so they all have equal opportunity to learn. "
