    "In my own community, I've seen how online schooling back in 2020 negatively affected my family back in India. They come from a lower socio-economic class and technology isn't readily availabe for them. Being blocked and kept from going to school in-person affected the education that many of my cousins got. This was extremley different from my own online schooling experience, since I'm more privilaged in the sense that I have access to technology, which is an example of the Digital Divide. To solve this issue, I think they can do something similar to PUSD, when they lended school chrombeooks to all students, so they all have equal opportunity to learn. "

A streaming service can monitor the things you watch and then filter out movies/ tv shows that you would not like. Explicit is when you fill out account information on a website like Amazon and give them things like your name, address, age, etc. So, overall, implicit data is indirectly taken from you, and explicit is information that you voluntarily give up.

    "Crowdsourcing has led to many developments in moden society, as it allows for collaboration and community engagment. Through Crowd Creation and Crowd Wisdom, members of diverse communities and societs are able to come together with their different persepctive and create one project. Things like Wikipedia depend on public effort, and other sites like Reddit, Instagram, or TikTok would be useless without crowdsourcing. This also related to distrubted computing, as editing in Wikipedia and posting on social media usually happend induvidually in diffeerent locations. Furthermore, Crowd Voting and Crowd Funding allows room for public opinion and input. This relates to open source development because software that is open to the public is done properly because of public input. \n"
