    "|    Digital Divide      |     - The Digital Divide can happen because of language barriers, socio-economic class, physical borders, and much more. It doesn't always concern money. Improvements in infrastructure and opportunity can lessen this divide.     | [Notes](https://github.com/prajnar123123213/prajna_2025/issues/14)|\n",
    "|  Computing Bias        |   - Explicit Data is things the user directly provides when signing up for a platform. Implicit Data is data that's inferred based off of the user's activity. Algorithmic Bias is when there is a faulty computer system. Cognitive Bias is when a person introduces their own subconcious bias. Data Bias is caused by small, inaccurate data.     | [Notes](https://github.com/prajnar123123213/prajna_2025/issues/15)         |\n",
    "|     Crowdsourcing     |  â€¢ Crowdfunding: Raise money by collecting small contributions. Leads to innovation by allowing small companies to launch. Crowd Creation: design competitions, wikipedia. Leads to innovation by allowing multiple people to be creative and work together. Crowd Voting: Collect public opinion through surveys. By taking public opinion into account, society can innovate better. Crowd Wisdom: Using collective intelligence for problem-solving. (Reddit, Quora, etc). Leads to innovation by allowing people to get their questions answered.        |   [Notes](https://github.com/prajnar123123213/prajna_2025/issues/15)       | \n",

Timing is also a strenght, since I can finish the test at a faster pace. I should make sure to mark down questions that I consistently struggle with so I can review at the end. | Improvments should be made around actual coding concepts. Questions that ask to analyze code or fill in the missing code is a constant struggle for me. I'm going to work on improving this by going over code that we do in class and using resources like ChatGPT or Gemini to quiz and help me. |\n",
