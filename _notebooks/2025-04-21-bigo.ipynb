    "The most efficient strategies are checking the last digit and then using the modulus operator to check if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0. This is because these methods both implement the O(1) operator, and options 2 and 3 only require one step. When checking the last number, it's only one step, and there are only 5 options to check from. As for the modulus, this operation is also one step since it immediately gives back the result of whether the number is 0 or not.\n",

    "The merge sort is consistantly faster than the bubble sort because it splits up the values rather than tackling each one induvidually. By dividing and conquering, merge sorting reduces the number of comparisons need to run the algorithm. Bubble sort has a larger time complexity since it has to manually switch each value that is next to the starting item. \n",

It cuts down the list in half each time, causing the algortihm to be more efficient and work faster compared to the linear search that makes comparisons at each item given in a list. This is why the Linear search is given by O(n). \n",
